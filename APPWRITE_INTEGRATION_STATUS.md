## Your Database Details
- **Database ID**: `6843c9bc00393fb3ff24`
- **Endpoint**: `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1`
- **Status**: Active and fully functional

## Testing the Integration

Visit `/appwrite-demo` to test:
1. Create users with Appwrite documents
2. Save technology stacks to your database
3. View real-time data from your Appwrite collections

## API Endpoints Available

All endpoints now use Appwrite:
- `POST /api/users` - Create user
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `GET /api/users/username/:username` - Get user by username
- `PATCH /api/users/:id` - Update user profile
- `GET /api/users/:userId/stacks` - Get user's stacks
- `POST /api/users/:userId/stacks` - Save new stack
- `DELETE /api/users/:userId/stacks/:stackId` - Delete stack

## Next Steps

Your application is now fully running on Appwrite Cloud. All user data and technology stacks will be persisted in your Appwrite database. The integration supports:

- Real-time data operations
- User management
- Stack saving and retrieval
- Scalable cloud storage
- Built-in security and permissions

The migration from SQL to Appwrite is complete and functional.
